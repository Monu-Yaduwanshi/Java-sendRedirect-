# sendRedirect-
This repository contains a Java Servlet project that demonstrates how to implement a simple search functionality using Java Servlets, with redirection to Google search results. The project is developed using Eclipse IDE, deployed on an Apache Tomcat server, and structured to easily integrate with MySQL for database interactions if needed.

# sendRedirect - Java Servlet Google Search Redirection 🌐

Welcome to the **sendRedirect** project! 🚀 This repository demonstrates a simple yet effective way to integrate Java Servlets with Google Search by capturing user input from a search bar and dynamically redirecting to Google with the provided query. Perfect for learning the basics of servlet redirection and HTTP request handling!

## 📜 Project Overview

The **sendRedirect** project illustrates how to create a search functionality where user input from a form is processed by a servlet, and the user is redirected to Google Search with the query. It showcases Java Servlet's capability to manage HTTP responses and redirections, with the potential for future integration with MySQL for more advanced features like saving search history.

## ✨ Features

- **🔍 Google Search Integration**: Users enter a search query, and the servlet redirects them directly to Google’s search results page.
- **⏩ Dynamic Redirection**: If the user submits an empty query, the servlet brings them back to the search page, prompting for valid input.
- **📂 Servlet Mapping**: Configured via `web.xml`, the servlet is mapped to the `/SearchServlet` endpoint for easy access.
- **💻 Responsive HTML Form**: The search form is built with a clean, minimalist design using HTML and CSS, ensuring an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java Servlets (Jakarta Servlet API)**: Handles HTTP requests and responses, with redirection functionality.
- **MySQL Database (Optional)**: Although not implemented here, the project is structured for easy integration with a MySQL database for future features like logging or user management.
- **Apache Tomcat Server**: The servlet is deployed on Apache Tomcat, which manages the server-side functionality.
- **Eclipse IDE**: Developed in Eclipse IDE, providing a robust environment for easy code management, debugging, and project extension.
